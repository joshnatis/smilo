## Nota Bene

Firstly, neither of these directories contains a complete application. I haven't uploaded the cruft files created by Expo CLI
and React Native. However, the 'main' code (namely, in `App.js`) is here, and if you have something set up you can probably just
copy it over to your file and all should be well.

Secondly, this application has yet to be completed. Essentially, in hip lingo these are minimum viable products (viable
may be a stretch here). 

Lastly: V1 and V2 are two different apps. I wrote V1 while trying to figure out React Native, essentially overnight.
It's primitive (it's essentially a styled page with an image and buttons), but I also had a clear vision on how to proceed 
to make it into a Duolingo-style thingy mabob. V2 was written by a friend, and I believe the two share no common code. 
It's also much more complex, though it strays a bit from our original idea.

This is here for conservation purposes. Perhaps I will finish it one day : ).
