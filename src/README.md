## Nota Bene

Firstly, neither of these directories contains a complete application. I haven't uploaded the cruft files created by Expo CLI
and React Native. However, the 'main' code (namely, in `App.js`) is here, and if you have something set up you can probably just
copy it over to your file and all should be well.

Secondly, this application has yet to be completed. Essentially, in hip lingo these are minimum viable products (viable
may be a stretch here). 

Lastly: V1 and V2 are two different apps. I wrote V1 while trying to figure out React Native, and as such it's pretty much just a styled page with an image and button. I meant to keep working on it to make it into a Duolingo-style thingy mabob, but time didn't permit. V2 was written by a [friend](https://github.com/lohs), and it's pretty much a different app lol.

This is here for conservation purposes. Perhaps I will finish it one day : ).
